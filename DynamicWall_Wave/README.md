# MoMath DynamicWall Wave-collision

## Overview

This Wave illustration is made for the DynamicWall at MoMath NYC. 
https://github.com/momath/dynamic-wall

Dynamic Wall is the huge sculpture-esque exhibit you saw on the right hand side as you entered the Museum. 
It has 128 metal slats, the depth of which are individually controllable on both the top and the bottom. 
Use the surface or creases between the slabs to create interesting and mathematically-illuminating effects. 
This project uses the programming language Processing.

Waves are always around us in the form of sound, radio, wifi ect. Yet due to its invisible nature to us, we may not be aware of the properties of waves. 
This visulization shows 2 sine waves coming from either side and their interaction as they collide in the centre. It demonstrate phenomenons of wave such as constructive or destructive interference as they intersect with each other.
