MoMath Hackathon 2018 - Math Square

Dynamic Binary Wall
File Location: binary.java

The Dynamic Binary Wall for the National Museum of Mathematics Math Square(MoMath) exhibit creates the opportunity for collaborative and visualization tool to help promote the understanding of the base-2 numeral system as well a positive perception of mathematics. The Dynamic Wall can be seen immediately upon walking into the museum as it is a huge “sculpture-esque,”with 128 metal slats, the depth of which can be controlled individually. The 128 metal slats were split evenly into 32 positions notation, with every 4 metal slats representing a digit or one bit.

About Binary Numbers
Computers use bits, not digits, however. Bits can only be '0' or '1'. For this reason computers use base 2, also called the binary number system.

In the binary number system, a number such as 11010, each place represents a power of 2, just as each place represents a power of 10 in the decimal number system. The right-most bit is the 1's place; the bit to its left is the 2's place, the bit to its left is the 4's place, then the 8's place, the 16's place, the 32's place, the 64's place, the 128's place, and so on. So we translate 11010 to mean 1 sixteen, 1 eight, 0 fours, 1 two, and 0 ones, or, again,

1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0
To see what 11010 is in the decimal numbers we know and love, we can reeevaluate this in base 10: 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 26.

Exhibit Features
Displays binary number systems and potential curiousity for other various representation of numbers.
The Binary value can represent upto 2^32 numbers.
This project can serve as a platform and inspiration for future software developers as it leaves much room for additional implementation such as 2'complement or digital logic, etc.
